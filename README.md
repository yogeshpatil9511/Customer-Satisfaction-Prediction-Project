🚀## *** Customer Satisfaction Prediction Project***


🔍 ## **Overview**
Welcome to the Customer Satisfaction Prediction Project!
This machine learning project predicts how satisfied customers 
are with their tech product support experience. 
By diving into a rich dataset of customer support tickets,
we uncover patterns and build a model to predict satisfaction ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. 
Whether you're a data science enthusiast or a business aiming to enhance customer service, 
this project offers actionable insights into customer behavior and support trends.

## ***📌 Project Goals***
We're analyzing customer support tickets for tech products like cameras, smart TVs, and software. Each ticket provides details such as:

##Customer Info: Age, gender, email
##Product Details: Purchased item and date
##Ticket Details: Issue type (e.g., technical, billing), priority, resolution
##Satisfaction Rating: Customer happiness (1–5)


## ***Objectives:***

✅ Explore data to identify trends (e.g., common issues, ticket patterns)
✅ Build a machine learning model to predict satisfaction ratings
✅ Visualize key insights (e.g., factors driving customer happiness)

## ***📂 Dataset***
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle (customer_support_tickets.csv), contains 8,469 tickets with 17 features:

## 🆔 Ticket ID: Unique identifier
## 🎯 Customer Age/Gender: Demographic details
## 🛒 Product Purchased: Tech product involved
## 📝 Ticket Type/Subject: Nature of the issue
## 🚦 Ticket Status/Priority: Current state and urgency
## 📊 Customer Satisfaction Rating: Target variable (1–5, for closed tickets)
#3 ⏳ Resolution Time: Time to resolve the issue



##**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Languages: Python, SQL (for querying, if needed)
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
Domain: Data Science, Machine Learning

##**🚀 Project Steps**

## Data Preprocessing 🧹
Clean data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
Visualize trends (e.g., common ticket types, satisfaction by gender)


## Feature Engineering ⚙️
Prepare features for modeling (scaling, encoding)


## Model Building 🤖
Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict satisfaction


## Model Evaluation 📈
Assess accuracy and analyze feature importance


## Visualizations 🎨
Create plots for trends, distributions, and insights



## ***📊 Key Findings***

Common Issues: Refund requests, software bugs, and product compatibility are top ticket subjects
Satisfaction Trends: Ratings are evenly distributed (1–5), with a mean of ~2.99
Demographics: Most tickets come from ages 31–60; gender distribution is balanced
Top Products: Canon EOS, GoPro Hero, and LG Smart TV are frequently reported
Model Performance: Random Forest Classifier achieves ~70–80% accuracy
