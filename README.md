🚀 ****Customer Satisfaction Prediction Project****

🔍 ***Overview***
      Welcome to the Customer Satisfaction Prediction project! This machine learning initiative helps predict how satisfied customers are with their tech product support experience. By analyzing 
     customer support ticket data, we aim to uncover patterns and build an accurate predictive model for satisfaction ratings (scale of 1 to 5). Whether you're a data science enthusiast or a 
     business optimizing customer service, this project delivers valuable insights into customer behavior and support trends.

📌 ***What’s This Project About?***
We’re working with a dataset of customer support tickets related to tech products like cameras, smart TVs, and software. Each ticket includes details such as: 📊 Customer Info – Age, gender, and email 📦 Product Details – What they purchased and when 📑 Ticket Details – Issue type (e.g., technical, billing), priority, and resolution details ⭐ Satisfaction Rating – Scale of 1–5, based on resolution experience

**Goals:**
✅ Explore the data to find trends (common issues, ticket patterns) ✅ Build a machine learning model to predict customer satisfaction ✅ Visualize insights (e.g., key factors that influence happy customers)

📂 **Dataset Information**
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 8,469 customer support tickets with 17 features, including:

🆔 **Ticket ID – Unique identifier**
🎯 Customer Age/Gender – Demographic info 🛒 Product Purchased – Tech product associated with the ticket 📝 Ticket Type/Subject – Nature of the issue 🚦 Ticket Status/Priority – Current state and urgency 📊 Customer Satisfaction Rating – Target variable (scale of 1–5) ⏳ Resolution Time – Time taken to resolve issues

⚠️ Missing Data Handling: Satisfaction ratings may be missing for unresolved tickets, and we address this during preprocessing.

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**
🔷 Languages: Python, SQL (for queries if needed) 🔷 Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn 🔷 Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code 🔷 Domain: Data Science, Machine Learning

🚀** Project Steps**
Step 1️⃣: Data Preprocessing 🧹
🔹 Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables

Step 2️⃣: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
🔹 Visualize trends, such as common ticket types or satisfaction patterns by gender

Step 3️⃣: Feature Engineering ⚙️
🔹 Prepare data for modeling (scaling & encoding)

Step 4️⃣: Model Building 🤖
🔹 Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer satisfaction

Step 5️⃣: Model Evaluation 📈
🔹 Evaluate accuracy & analyze feature importance

Step 6️⃣: Visualizations 🎨
🔹 Generate graphs showcasing findings (ticket trends, satisfaction levels, etc.)

📊 **Key Findings**
🔹 Common Issues: Top ticket topics include refund requests, software bugs, and compatibility concerns 🔹 Satisfaction Trends: Ratings range between 1–5 with a mean score of ~2.99 🔹 Demographics: Customers aged 31–60 raise the most tickets; gender distribution is balanced 🔹 Popular Products: Canon EOS, GoPro Hero, LG Smart TV lead in issue reports 🔹 Model Performance: The Random Forest Classifier achieves an accuracy of ~70–80%
